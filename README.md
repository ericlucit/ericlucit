I am the CTO and co-founder of Lucit, specializing in big-ticket inventory marketing software with a focus on digital billboards.

## Lucit Layout

Our flagship application is [Lucit Layout](https://lucit.cc/lucit-layout/) 

Lucit Layout inventory platform is designed to improve the myriad of systems that auto, ag, rec, and heavy equipment dealers use to promote and publish their inventories directly from their dealership management systems to any third-party vendor that can accept feeds.

Layout transforms the data coming out of your system to ensure that it is accurate and the photos are branded and beautiful. Layout provides real-time verification that each of your third-party websites contain updated and accurate listings.

It also can generate a specialized billboard export that it shares directly with any third-party digital billboard company. 

Using the Lucit Layout Smartphone App or Desktop Application, users can choose specific inventory items or set broad filters to display inventory on the boards. 

Layout empowers you to define rules that the system uses to generate designs and export those creatives to your digital billboard rotation. 

Users can set it and forget it: if an item that is currently on the board sells, Lucit Layout will automatically remove the sold item from the billboard
