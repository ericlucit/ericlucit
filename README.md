Nice—this homepage actually tells a very clean, infrastructure-level story, which is perfect for a GitHub profile. Below is a **GitHub-ready intro** that balances *technical credibility*, *product vision*, and *DOOH context* without sounding like marketing fluff. You can paste this directly into your GitHub profile README and tweak tone if you want it more casual or more founder-polished.

### CTO and Co-Founder of Lucit

I’m the CTO and co-founder of **Lucit**, a platform built to power **dynamic, data-driven Digital Out-of-Home (DOOH)** advertising at scale.

At Lucit, we solve one core problem:
**how to design once and deploy dynamic creatives everywhere — on any screen, any size, across any vendor — without manual rework.**

Lucit acts as **infrastructure for modern DOOH**, automating the hardest parts of the creative side of the ecosystem:

* Connecting live data sources (APIs, feeds, spreadsheets, real-time signals)
* Generating responsive creative templates that adapt to hundreds of screen formats
* Deploying and updating campaign creatives across operators, SSPs, DSPs, and signage platforms automatically

The result: dynamic campaigns that scale exponentially **without** exponential increases in creative production, ops work, or engineering overhead.

### What I Work On

I'm hands-on across the full stack and product architecture:

* **Distributed systems & APIs** for real-time creative generation
* **Template engines** that resize and adapt creatives automatically across formats
* **Live data pipelines** (sports, weather, retail, automotive, finance, community, and more)
* **Infrastructure-level integrations** with media owners, agencies, and buying platforms
* **Developer tooling** that makes DOOH programmable instead of manual
